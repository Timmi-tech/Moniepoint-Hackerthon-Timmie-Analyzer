Moniepoint Hackerthon - Timmie Analyzer

📌 Project Overview

Timmie Analyzer is a Python-based data analytics tool designed to process and extract valuable insights from transaction records. It was developed as part of the Moniepoint Hackathon challenge.

🚀 Features

Parses transaction files from multiple test case folders.

Computes key sales analytics:

Highest Sales Volume Day (Most Transactions)

Highest Sales Value Day (Most Revenue)

Most Sold Product (By Quantity)

Top Sales Staff per Month

Busiest Hour of the Day (Most Transactions)

Generates a detailed sales report.

Web Interface built using Django for easy file uploads and visualization.

🏗️ Problem-Solving Approach

Understanding the Problem: Extracting key business insights from multiple transaction .txt files.

Data Collection: Reading multiple .txt files inside a folder and extracting relevant data.

Data Processing: Parsing transaction details (e.g., sales staff ID, transaction time, products sold, etc.).

Data Analysis: Using dictionaries to compute:

Sales volume per day

Sales value per day

Most sold product

Top sales staff per month

Busiest transaction hour

Compiling Results: Structuring findings for output.

Output & Reporting: Saving results in a structured report (sales_report.txt).

Enhancing Accessibility: Building a Django-based UI for file uploads and real-time analysis.

Adding Features: Supporting .zip file uploads (since Django does not accept folders) and improving the UI using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
